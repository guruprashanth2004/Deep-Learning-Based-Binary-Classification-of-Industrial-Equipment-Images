#Industrial Equipment Defect Classifier
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of industrial equipment as either defective or non-defective. The project includes code for training, evaluating, and testing the model, along with instructions for using the model with uploaded images.

Features
Binary classification of industrial equipment images.
Pre-trained CNN model for high accuracy.
Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.
Test individual images for defect classification.
